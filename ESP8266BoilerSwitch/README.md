* Uses MQTT to switch the boiler on or off
* Uses the Wemos D1 Mini and Wemos D1 Mini Relay Shield
* Programmed using the Arduino IDE

## 20 August 2016
* Changed communication between esp8266 device and node-red to use JSON object strings.
* esp8266 replies to node-red to confirm current actual boiler state
	* Later this will be used to double check that the esp8266 board is still functioning.
